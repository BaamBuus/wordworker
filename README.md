# Wordworker
Wordworker is a quick word manager for .txt files written in Python.
I whipped it up on a TikTok live. (@bambus.png)

## What can it do?
A bunch of stuff, which I'm too lazy to note right now.
it counts words letters and stuff. soon ill add a text editing feature.

## Plans
I'm going to add support for more file types (text file types like .md)
